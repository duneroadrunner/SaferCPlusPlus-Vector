SaferCPlusPlus-Vector
=====================
Jan 2016

A collection of safe data types that are compatible with, and can substitute for common unsafe native c++ types. Currently these include a safe implementation of std::vector<>. I.e. bounds checked and "invalid iterator dereference" checked. Also, a couple of other highly compatible vectors that address the issue of unnecessary iterator invalidation upon insert, erase or reallocation. Also, replacements for the native "int", "size_t" and "bool" types that have default initialization values and automatically address the "signed-unsigned mismatch" issues. Also, a safe replacement for native pointers that, unlike std::shared_ptr for example, does not take ownership of the target (and so can point to objects on the stack). 

Tested with msvc2013, msvc2010 and g++4.8 (as of Dec 2015).
